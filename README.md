# BChaneyPA2

## Configuration

Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04

Python Interpreter: CPython 3.11.3

IDE/Editors

- NeoVim 0.9
- Visual Studio Code version 1.75.1

## How to Run

- We can test the algorithm by calling `python interweaving.py <s> <x> <y>`,
where we want to determine if `<s>` is an interweaving of `<x>` and `<y>`.
- For example, we can try: `python interweaving.py 100010101 101 0` to test if
`100010101` is an interweaving of `101` and `0`

## Additional Files

- Some data files are included in the data/ directory.
- All data files used in this project were generated by the python script
`interweaving_data.py`. The bash scripts `data.sh` and `experiments.sh` were
used to generate sets of data and get experimental numbers of comparisons.
